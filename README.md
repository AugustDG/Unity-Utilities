# Unity Utilities

[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.amp.unityutilities?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.amp.unityutilities/)

Utilities to improve the C# experience in Unity: ranging from more capabilities to shorter code length!

For now, to use this library, you need to copy the repo (or download it) and build a .dll file in Visual Studio,
Jetbrains Rider or any .NET IDE, to then add it to your Unity project! Alternatively, you can also copy all the scripts
in your project :) Don't forget to add the `UnityUtilities` namespace!

### OpenUPM

You can now install this as an UPM packge through OpenUPM! Here's the package [page](https://openupm.com/packages/com.amp.unityutilities/#) :D

Just open a terminal within your project and type:
```commandline
openupm add com.amp.unityutilities
```

or, manually install it through the package manager like [this](https://openupm.com/packages/com.amp.unityutilities/#modal-manualinstallation)!

### C# Version

Currently frozen at [#8.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8) for backwards compability
with `Unity 2020.2` and above!

## Patterns

A series of popular programming patterns, implemented in easy to use classes!

### Singletons

Through the controversy of using them, here are generic,
base [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20the%20singleton,mathematical%20concept%20of%20a%20singleton.)
classes to get you up and going if you need them!  

**Since Unity is singlethreaded, none of the following are thread safe!**

- `Singleton` &rarr; Generic singleton class, made for _MonoBehaviours_.
- `SingletonPersistent` &rarr; Generic persistent singleton class, made for _MonoBehaviours_. Persists through scene reloads.
- `SingletonLazy` &rarr; Generic lazy singleton class, made for _MonoBehaviours_. Creates itself, if it doesn't exist.
- `SingletonService` &rarr; A newer kind of a C# (doesn't interact with Unity) _Singleton_, only accessible through method calls. Mainly used for services.

## Coroutines

- `WaitUntilAndForSecondsRealtime` &rarr; Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using unscaled time and until the passed condition is true.
- `WaitUntilOrForSecondsRealtime` &rarr; Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using unscaled time or until the passed condition is true.
- `WaitWhileAndForSecondsRealtime` &rarr; Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using unscaled time and while the passed condition is true.
- `WaitWhileOrForSecondsRealtime` &rarr; Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using unscaled time or while the passed condition is true.

## Extensions

### Numerals

- `Round` &rarr; Rounds float and returns float; number of decimals can be specified.

- `Map` &rarr; Maps a float from the supplied range to the supplied range (for floats and ints).

### Movement

- `GoUp` &rarr; Smoothly translates the _gameobject_ (or transform) up at the desired speed (float).
- `GoDown` &rarr; Smoothly translates the _gameobject_ (or transform) down at the desired speed (float).
- `GoLeft` &rarr; Smoothly translates the _gameobject_ (or transform) left at the desired speed (float).
- `GoRight` &rarr; Smoothly translates the _gameobject_ (or transform) right at the desired speed (float).
- `GoForward` &rarr; Smoothly translates the _gameobject_ (or transform) forward at the desired speed (float).

- `FollowMouse2D` &rarr; Smoothly makes the _Rigidbody2D_ follow the mouse position at the desired speeds (float, float).
- `FollowObject2D` &rarr; Smoothly makes the _Rigidbody2D_ follow the specified object (or transform) at the desired
  speeds (float, float);

### Vectors

- `Round` &rarr; Rounds _Vector2_, _Vector3_ and returns a rounded vector with the specified number of decimals.
- `RoundToInt` &rarr; Rounds _Vector2_, _Vector3_ and returns _Vector2Int_.
- `Clamp` &rarr; Clamps the components of the Vector3 between supplied values.
- `VectorFromAngle` &rarr; Returns the corresponding vector to the given angle (in degrees or radians).
- `RotateByAngle` &rarr; Rotates the _Vector2_ by the given angle (in degress or radians). This method assumes +X axis
  is 0 degrees/radians.
- `AngleFromVector` &rarr; Returns the positive angle in degrees (or radians) of given _Vector2_. This method assumes +X
  axis is 0 degrees/radians.
- `TransformTo2DVector3` &rarr; Transforms _Vector2_ into _Vector3_ respecting Unity's coordinate system (so x = x, y =
  0, z = y).
- `ChopTo2DVector3` &rarr; Takes and returns a _Vector3_ respecting Unity's coordinate system (so x = x, y = 0 (or
  specified), z = y).
- `ToVector2` &rarr; Transforms a 2-big float array to a _Vector2_.
- `ToVector3` &rarr; Transforms a 3-big float array to a _Vector3_.
- `ToArray` &rarr; Transforms a _Vector3_ or _Vector2_ to a 3-big or 2-big float array, respectively.
- `GeoDistanceTo` &rarr; Calculates distance between two coordinates.

### Quaternions

- `AverageQuaternions` &rarr; Returns the average of the _Quaternions_.
- `AverageQuaternionsFast` &rarr; Returns the average of the _Quaternions_, without normalizing to save on speed.
- `Normalize` &rarr; Normalizes the _Quaternion_.
- `InverseSign` &rarr; Inverses the sign of the _Quaternion_.
- `IsClose` &rarr; Checks if the _Quaternion_ is close to the given one.
- `Scale` &rarr; Scales the _Quaternion_.

### GameObject
